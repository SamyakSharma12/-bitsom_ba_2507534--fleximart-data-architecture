# NoSQL Analysis – FlexiMart Product Catalog

## Section A: Limitations of RDBMS (≈150 words)

Traditional relational databases like MySQL are optimized for structured, tabular data with fixed schemas. FlexiMart’s product catalog, however, contains highly diverse products: laptops with attributes such as RAM and processor, shoes with size and color, groceries with weight and nutritional values. Modeling these in a single relational schema requires either a very wide table with many nullable columns or multiple specialized tables, both of which complicate queries and maintenance. Adding new product types forces schema changes, which are costly in relational systems because they require altering table definitions, migrating data, and updating application logic. Furthermore, storing customer reviews as nested data is awkward in RDBMS: reviews must be placed in separate tables and joined back to products, which increases query complexity and reduces performance for read‑heavy workloads. Overall, relational databases struggle with flexibility, evolving schemas, and hierarchical data, making them less suitable for a dynamic product catalog.

## Section B: NoSQL Benefits (≈150 words)

MongoDB, a document‑oriented NoSQL database, addresses these challenges effectively. Its flexible schema allows each product document to store attributes relevant only to that product type, without enforcing a rigid table structure. For example, laptops can include RAM and processor fields, while shoes can include size and color, all within the same collection. MongoDB supports embedded documents, enabling customer reviews to be stored directly inside the product document as an array. This reduces the need for joins and allows queries to retrieve products and their reviews in a single operation. Additionally, MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability: data can be distributed across multiple servers using sharding, which supports large catalogs and high query throughput. These features make MongoDB well‑suited for FlexiMart’s diverse product catalog, providing agility in handling new product types, efficient storage of nested data, and scalability to meet growing business demands.

## Section C: Trade‑offs (≈100 words)

While MongoDB offers flexibility, it comes with trade‑offs compared to MySQL. First, MongoDB does not provide strong ACID guarantees across multiple documents by default. Complex transactions spanning multiple products or orders may be harder to implement, which can be critical for e‑commerce systems requiring strict consistency. Second, MongoDB’s query language and indexing are powerful but less mature for complex relational joins. Analytical queries that span multiple entities may require more effort or external tools. Thus, while MongoDB excels at flexible product catalogs, MySQL remains stronger for transactional integrity and complex relational reporting.
